/*
Brute force is a simple algorithm but is slow when it comes to long texts, so if you have a small text, Brute
force is good to use. KMP avoids the rechecking matched characters problem that Brute force has, making it more efficient,
especially for repeating patterns. BoyerMoore if the fastest out of both of the algorithms, as can be
seen by the data, because its bad character and good suffix rules allow it to skip sections that it knows won't have the
pattern. This makes it good for longer patterns or texts. Choosing one of the algorithms depends on the pattern length and
text size. Brute force is good for small texts, KMP is better for texts that have lots of overlap or repeat patterns, and
BoyerMoore is good for longer texts and patterns.
